            <small>OpenOversightVA takes your privacy and security very seriously. OpenOversightVA is hosted on its own

            <p class="font-weight-300">
                OpenOversightVA uses HTTPS on all of its web servers and on all of our subdomains. However, since
                OpenOversightVA is hosted on its own subdomain and web server, it will be possible for employers, ISPs, or
                anyone performing network-level traffic analysis to identify that you have visited OpenOversightVA.
                OpenOversightVA <b>does not</b> maintain network logs on our web servers. We have explicitly disabled
                nginx from maintaining access or error logs, an example configuration can be found <a
                        href="https://github.com/lucyparsons/OpenOversight/blob/master/DEPLOY.md"
                        target="_blank">here</a>. We also do not block incoming connections from any regions or IP
                block, so we welcome traffic from any anonymity network such as Tor.

            <h3>What Is Collected</h3>
            <p class="font-weight-300">
                OpenOversightVA has a form for volunteers to submit data to us using Google Docs. This data is <b>not</b>
                hosted by OpenOversightVA and is outside of this Privacy Policy. The Submission Form does not require
                you to provide a name and we will not reject any submissions without names. Please note that Google and
                other third parties might collect your IPs and other identifying information. Google's Privacy Policy
